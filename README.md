# Date-Ticker

Simple little program to display the amout of time elapsed from a stored date, and also the cursor position
On start up it will check for a reg key in HKCU and if not there, will create one, and then prompt the user
to enter a date
Subsequent starts will just read the reg key and use it

The grey button will bring up the date form again should you want to change the date

To Exit the program, just click the left hand side of the bar

My first program, so not very optimised, and just trying to get to grips with Github and programming again.
